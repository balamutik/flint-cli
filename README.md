- 🛡️ **SHA-256 integrity verification** for all files
- 📁 **Directory support** with recursive file addition
- 🗜️ **Built-in compression** using gzip
- ⚡ **Streaming I/O operations** for memory efficiency with large files
- 🚀 **Parallel processing** with configurable worker pools for large operations
- 🌍 **Unicode support** for international file names
- 🔍 **Selective extraction** of specific files or directories
- 🛡️ **Authenticated encryption** preventing data tampering
- 🚀 **Optimized architecture** supports files of any size
- 🔧 **Simple CLI interface** for easy usage
- 📊 **Performance optimized** - handles multi-GB files efficiently
- 📈 **Progress reporting** for long-running operations

## 🏗️ Architecture

Flint Vault uses a unified, optimized architecture:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   CLI Layer     │  ← User commands (create, add, list, etc.)
├─────────────────┤
│  Commands Layer │  ← Command implementations and validation
├─────────────────┤
│ Unified Vault   │  ← Single comprehensive vault module
│    Module       │  ← All operations: create, add, extract, remove
├─────────────────┤
│  Crypto Layer   │  ← AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2, secure random
├─────────────────┤
│ Compression     │  ← Gzip compression for space efficiency
└─────────────────┘
```

**🔄 Recent Major Refactoring:**
- Consolidated separate modules into unified `vault.go` 
- Optimized memory usage with streaming operations
- Enhanced compression support
- Improved error handling and validation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/balamutik/flint-vault.git
cd flint-vault

# Build the application
go build -o flint-vault ./cmd

# Make it executable
chmod +x flint-vault
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Create a new encrypted vault
./flint-vault create -f my-vault.flint

# Add files to the vault with parallel processing
./flint-vault add -v my-vault.flint -s ./documents/ --workers 8 --progress

# Add files with automatic worker detection
./flint-vault add -v my-vault.flint -s ./large-directory/

# List vault contents
./flint-vault list -v my-vault.flint

# Extract all files with parallel processing (flat structure - default)
./flint-vault extract -v my-vault.flint -o ./extracted/ --workers 4

# Extract all files preserving directory structure
./flint-vault extract -v my-vault.flint -o ./restored/ --workers 4 --extract-full-path

# Extract specific files in parallel (flat structure)
./flint-vault extract -v my-vault.flint -o ./output/ --files file1.txt,file2.pdf --workers 2

# Extract specific files preserving directory structure
./flint-vault extract -v my-vault.flint -o ./output/ --files docs/report.pdf,project/src/ --workers 2 --extract-full-path

# Remove files from vault
./flint-vault remove -v my-vault.flint -t unwanted.txt

# Get vault information without password
./flint-vault info -f my-vault.flint
```

## 🔐 Security

Flint Vault employs multiple layers of security:

- **AES-256-GCM**: Authenticated encryption preventing both eavesdropping and tampering
- **PBKDF2**: Key derivation with 100,000 iterations using SHA-256
- **Cryptographically secure random**: All salts and nonces generated using crypto/rand
- **Memory safety**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory after use
- **Format validation**: Magic headers prevent accidental data corruption

### Tested Against

- ✅ Brute force password attacks
- ✅ Nonce reuse attacks  
- ✅ Data tampering attacks
- ✅ Side-channel information leaks
- ✅ File format corruption

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

- **Extensive test suite** for all core modules
- **32+** test functions with multiple scenarios
- **Security tests** for cryptographic components
- **Performance benchmarks** for large files
- **Edge case testing** for robustness
- **Stress testing** with multi-GB datasets

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run benchmarks
go test -bench=. ./...
```

### 🏆 Stress Test Results

**Recently tested with 2.45 GB of data (4 files: 400MB-800MB each):**

| Operation | Time | Peak Memory | Speed | Workers | Status |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------|---------|---------|
| Vault Creation | <1s | 4 MB | - | - | ✅ |
| Adding Files (Parallel) | 40s | 13.3 GB | 61 MB/s | Auto | ✅ |
| Adding Files (8 Workers) | 35s | 14.1 GB | 70 MB/s | 8 | ✅ |
